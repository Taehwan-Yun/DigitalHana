## Project Description
- This project aims to develop AI-based, life-oriented digital services to increase MAU of Hana Bankâ€™s app.
- The closer it is to daily life and the more convenient it is, the more advantageous it is for increasing MAU.
- Recently, the gathering activity craze has been blowing and is starting to take root in the lives of the younger generation.
- Therefore, we developed a gathering management service combined with a location recommendation function to increase MAU targeting the younger generation.
- Below is a conceptual diagram of the POI (Point of Interest) recommendation model utilized in this service.
